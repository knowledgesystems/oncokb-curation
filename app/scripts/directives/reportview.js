            'The OncoVantage(TM) test was designed to detect mutations present in DNA from solid tumors. This DNA sequencing test utilizes PCR and next generation sequencing technology (using the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer). The current test interrogates the most commonly mutated exons in 34 genes. The genes (listed below) were selected based on actionability of mutations identified in those genes using currently available evidence from national and international guidelines and literature. Actionability is defined as information a clinician can use to help guide diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment strategy for a patient. Results of the test should be correlated with clinical findings. Clinical trial information provided in this report is solely for informational purposes for the physician and does not constitute any endorsement or a recommendation for enrollment of patients in any trial by Quest Diagnostics, its affiliates, or its employees.<br/><br/>Only mutations present in the interrogated exons of the genes are reported. The test does not identify any mutations present outside the interrogated regions, or larger rearrangements, or copy number changes (amplifications or whole exon/gene deletions). Normal population variations and synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are not included in this report (unless strong evidence is available indicating effect on splicing and impacting protein function). This test has sensitivity for detecting 5% SNVs and 10% INDEL mutated sequences in a background of non-mutated DNA sequence. The performance characteristics can change based on adequacy of tumor tissue or pre-analytical variables (This test was validated on FFPE, bone marrow and whole blood.)<br/>The genes examined are AKT1, ALK, BRAF, CTNNB1, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, FBXW7, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FOXL2, GNA11, GNAQ, GNAS, HRAS, IDH1, IDH2, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTCH1, PTEN, RET, SMO, STK11, TP53.<br/><br/>The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center name and logo are registered trademarks owned by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and used by Quest under license.
